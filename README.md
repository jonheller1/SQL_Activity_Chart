SQL Activity Chart - 1.3.0
============

SQL Activity Chart is an Oracle SQL query that displays all SQL activity for a database for a configurable amount of time.  It's sort of a cross between an AWR report and an ASH report.

The text-only format makes it less pretty than other tuning tools.  But the text format also allows it to fit much more data on a single page, and makes it easier to share.


## Example

The example below shows all the sections and features.  Reports are usually a few hundred lines long.  For brevity, some of the large sections with "`...`".
